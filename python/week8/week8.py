# Week 8: (Lab Day) More Data Structures in Python

"""
Here's a recommended framework for how to solve coding challenges you'll
typically see in coding interviews.

Step 1: Understand the problem
Read the problem statement carefully and identify the input and output requirements.

Step 2: Plan your approach
Think about the data structures and algorithms that could be used to solve the problem efficiently.

Step 3: Write Pseudocode (if necessary)
Write in pseudocode, or even type out in bullet points all the steps you need to do to solve the problem.
As you get more experienced this will become less of a necessity and you can go straight into coding.

Step 4: Write your code
Based off your approach and pseudocode, write out your solution in Python, using the fundamentals
you've already learned. At this point referencing previous material or online resources is good!
