POST CLASS TASK - GROUP ANAGRAMS

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An anagram is a word/phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word/phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation: 
    "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams.
    "tan" and "nat" are anagrams.
    "bat" has no anagrams.

Example 2: 
Input: strs = ["hello", "world", "python", "java"]
Output: [["hello"], ["world"], ["python"], ["java"]]

Explanation:
    None of these words are anagrams, so each remains in its own group.
